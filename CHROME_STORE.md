🌟 WHY ENORETT?

Swedish grammatical gender is one of the hardest parts of learning the language. 
There's no clear rule for when to use "en" vs "ett" - you just have to memorize 
each word. Traditional dictionaries are slow and break your workflow.

EnorEtt solves this by putting the answer right where you need it, instantly.

Made in Sweden 🇸🇪 by Swedish learners, for Swedish learners.

📖 LEARNING RESOURCES

EnorEtt doesn't just tell you the answer - it helps you learn. Pattern 
explanations teach you common rules like:

• Words ending in -het, -ing, -tion are usually "en" words
• Words ending in -ium, -ande, -ment are usually "ett" words
• And many more helpful patterns!

🚀 WHAT'S NEXT

We're constantly improving EnorEtt based on user feedback. Upcoming features:
• Expanded dictionary (10,000+ words)
• Example sentences
• Pronunciation audio
• Firefox and Edge versions
• Mobile apps
• And much more!
