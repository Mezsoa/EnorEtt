🇸🇪 Launching EnorEtt today!

After 2 years of constantly fumbling "en bil" vs "ett hus" while learning Swedish, I finally built the tool I wish existed from day one.

Thread on why Swedish is beautiful but grammatically brutal 👇

#Swedish #LanguageLearning #ChromeExtension
```

**Tweet 2 - The Problem**
```
If you've ever learned Swedish, you know THE struggle:

"Is it 'en bok' or 'ett bok'?"

There's no rule. You just have to... memorize. Every. Single. Noun.

Dictionary lookup takes 30+ seconds and kills your flow.
```

**Tweet 3 - The Solution**
```
EnorEtt gives you the answer in under 1 second ⚡

• Type any Swedish noun
• Get instant en/ett answer
• See patterns to help you learn
• Works completely offline

Right where you need it, when you need it.
```

**Tweet 4 - Demo GIF**
```
Here's how it works:

[Attach 10-second GIF of:
- Clicking extension icon
- Typing "bil"
- Seeing "en bil ✅" result]

That's it. Simple. Fast. Beautiful.
```

**Tweet 5 - Context Menu Feature**
```
Even better: Right-click ANY word on ANY website

Select → Right-click → "Kolla en/ett"

No more copy-pasting into dictionaries. No more breaking your flow.

It just works. 🎯
```

**Tweet 6 - Why It's Different**
```
What makes EnorEtt special:

✅ Only tool focused on en/ett
✅ Works offline (1000+ words)
✅ Pattern learning included
✅ Beautiful Scandinavian design
✅ Free forever
✅ No tracking, no ads

Made by learners, for learners.
```

**Tweet 7 - The Stats**
```
Quick Swedish facts:

• ~70% of nouns are "en" words
• ~30% are "ett" words
• Zero reliable patterns 😅

But common endings can help:
• -het, -ing, -tion → usually EN
• -ium, -ande, -ment → usually ETT

EnorEtt teaches you these!
```

**Tweet 8 - Who It's For**
```
Perfect if you're:

• Learning Swedish (any level)
• Moving to Sweden for work
• Taking SFI classes
• Writing in Swedish
• Teaching Swedish
• Just curious about languages

Basically: anyone who's ever typed "en eller ett" into Google 😂
```

**Tweet 9 - The Story**
```
Personal story time:

I moved to Stockholm in 2023. Duolingo got me basics, but real-world Swedish was HARD.

Biggest frustration? En/ett mistakes in every email, every text, every Slack message.

I got tired of guessing wrong. So I built this.
```

**Tweet 10 - Tech Stack**
```
For the makers out there:

• Manifest V3 Chrome Extension
• Vanilla JS (no frameworks!)
• 1000-word local dictionary
• Pattern-matching fallback
• Optional Node.js/Express API
• Scandinavian design principles

Simple tech. Solid execution.
```

**Tweet 11 - Offline-First**
```
Why offline-first matters:

🛫 Works on flights
🚇 Works in the tunnelbana
🏔️ Works in the Swedish mountains
📱 Works without data
💰 No API costs

Your data stays on YOUR device. Always.
```

**Tweet 12 - Free Forever**
```
"How much does it cost?"

FREE. Forever.

No ads. No tracking. No upsells (yet).

I believe language learning should be accessible. Maybe I'll add Pro features later, but the core will always be free.

If it helps you, that's enough. ❤️
```

**Tweet 13 - Roadmap**
```
What's next for EnorEtt:

v1.1 → User contributions
v1.5 → 10,000+ word API
v2.0 → AI-powered phrase checker
v3.0 → Full grammar suite

But for now: just solving the en/ett problem really, really well.
```

## 🔴 Reddit Launch Posts

### r/Svenska Post

**Title:** [Tool] I built a Chrome extension for instant en/ett lookup - thought you might find it useful!

**Body:**
```
Hej allihopa!

After two years of learning svenska and STILL messing up "en" and "ett" 
constantly, I finally got frustrated enough to build a tool to help.

**What it is:**
A free Chrome extension that tells you instantly if a word takes "en" or "ett"

**How it works:**
1. Click the icon or right-click any Swedish word
2. Get the answer in <1 second
3. See pattern explanations to help you learn

**Features:**
- 1000+ common words built-in
- Works completely offline
- Context menu (right-click any word)
- Pattern detection for unknown words
- Beautiful, minimal design

**Why I built it:**
Looking up en/ett in dictionaries takes forever and breaks your flow. This 
solves that problem.

**Download:** [Chrome Web Store Link]

It's completely free, no ads, no tracking. I just wanted to solve my own 
problem and figured others might benefit too.

Would love to hear feedback from fellow Swedish learners!

Är det "en extension" eller "ett extension"? 😄
(Spoiler: It's neither - extensions don't translate directly, but EnorEtt 
will tell you "en tillägg" is correct!)

Tack!
```

### r/LearnSwedish Post

**Title:** Finally solved the "en eller ett" problem - free Chrome extension

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone,

If you're like me, you've Googled "en eller ett [word]" about 1000 times.

I got tired of it and built EnorEtt - a Chrome extension that gives you the 
answer instantly without leaving whatever you're doing.

**Quick demo:**
- Right-click "bil" on any Swedish website
- Select "Kolla en/ett för 'bil'"
- Popup shows "en bil ✅"

Or just click the icon and type any word.

**Features:**

✅ Pattern detection for new words  
✅ Works anywhere in Chrome
✅ Free forever

**Download:** [Link]

Not trying to promote - just sharing something I made for myself that might 
help others. Feedback welcome!

P.S. If you want to test it, try these tricky ones:
- museum (surprise! it's "ett")
- garage (it's "ett"!)
- problem (also "ett"!)

Most loanwords are "ett" which nobody tells you when you start learning 😅
```

🇸🇪 Launching EnorEtt: A Chrome Extension for Swedish Learners

After relocating to Stockholm for work, I faced a challenge that millions 
of Swedish learners encounter: the grammatical gender system.

In Swedish, every noun takes either "en" or "ett" - and there's no 
consistent rule. You just have to memorize each word.

Traditional solutions:
• Dictionaries: Slow, breaks workflow
• Google: Inconsistent results
• Asking colleagues: Embarrassing

So I built EnorEtt - a Chrome extension that gives you the answer in 
under 1 second, right where you're working.

**Key features:**
→ 1,000+ word offline dictionary
→ Context menu integration
→ Pattern-based learning
→ Privacy-first design

**Target market:**
→ 13M Swedish learners globally
→ International professionals in Sweden
→ SFI students
→ Translation/content professionals

**Business model:**
Freemium: Core features free forever, with optional Pro tier for advanced 
features and API access.

Available now on Chrome Web Store (free).

This is v1.0. Roadmap includes API expansion, mobile apps, and AI-powered 
grammar assistance.

Fellow founders: Happy to discuss technical choices, GTM strategy, or just 
chat about building in public.

Swedish learners: Try it and let me know what you think!

EnorEtt is a Chrome extension that gives you the answer instantly:
• Click icon or right-click any word
• Get answer in <1 second
• See patterns to help you learn
• Works completely offline

**Why It's Different:**
→ ONLY tool focused on this specific problem
→ Offline-first (no API latency)
→ Beautiful Scandinavian design
→ Free forever

Manifest V3 Chrome Extension, vanilla JS, 1000-word local dictionary, 
pattern-matching algorithms.

**What's Next:**
→ v1.5: 10K+ word API
→ v2.0: AI phrase checker
→ v3.0: Full grammar suite

**Special Offer for PH:**
First 100 upvoters get lifetime Pro access when it launches (worth $30/year)!

Try these words to test it:
• bil → en bil ✅
• hus → ett hus ✅
• problem → ett problem ✅

Questions? Fire away! I'll be here all day.

Tack! (That's "thank you" in Swedish 😊)
